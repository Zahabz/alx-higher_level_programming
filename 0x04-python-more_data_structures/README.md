# 0x04-python-more_data_structures


## Learning Objectives :dart:

At the end of this project, a student was expected to explain:

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What are sets and how to use them
* What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
* When to use sets versus lists
* How to iterate into a set
* What are dictionaries and how to use them
* When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
* What is a key in a dictionary
* How to iterate over a dictionary
* What is a lambda function
* What are the map, reduce and filter functions


## Tasks involved :page with curl:

* **1. Finding the squares of integers in a matrix**
  * [0-square_matrix_simple.py](0-square_matrix_simple.py): In this task, the prototype function `def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):` will be used to find the square of each value in the matrix.

* **2. Search and replace**
  * [1-search_replace.py](1-search_replace.py): This python file replaces all occurrences of a particular element with another in a **new list**. The prototype function used is `def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):`

* **3. Unique addition**
  * [2-uniq_add.py](2-uniq_add.py): Adds all unique integers in a list excluding their duplicates. The prototype function used is `def uniq_add(my_list=[]):`.

* **4. Set operation 1**
  * [3-common_elements](3-common_elements): Returns a set of common elements in two sets using the function `def common_elements(set_1, set_2):`.

* **5. Set operation 2**
  * [4-only_diff_elements.py](4-only_diff_elements.py): Returns elements present only in one set using the prototype function `def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2`.

* **6. Set operations 3**
  * [5-number_keys.py](5-number_keys.py): Returns the number of keys in a dictionary using the prototype function `def number_keys(a_dictionary`.

* **7. Number of dictionary keys**
  * [6-print_sorted_dictionary](6-print_sorted_dictionary): Returns an ordered dictionary based solely on its keys using the prototype function `def print_sorted_dictionary`.

* **8. Updating a dictionary**
  * [7-update_dictionary.py](7-update_dictionary.py): Replaces or adds a key and its value to a dictionary or updates it. The prototype function used is `def update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value):`

* **9. Deletion of a key in a dictionary**
  * [8-simple_delete.py](8-simple_delete.py): Consists of a function that deletes a key from a dictionary. The prototype function used is `def simple_delete(a_dictionary, key=""):`.

* **10. Multiplication of dictionary values by a number**
  * [9-multiply_by_2.py](9-multiply_by_2.py): Contains a function that multiplies all dictionary values by 2 and returns a new dictionary. THe prototype function used is `def multiply_by_2(a_dictionary):`.
