# 0x0A. Python-Inheritance

## Learning objectives :dart:

* What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
* What is a subclass
* How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
* When can an instance have new attributes
* How to inherit class from another
* How to define a class with multiple base classes
* What is the default class every class inherit from
* How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
* Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
* What is the purpose of inheritance
* What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions

## Tasks to be completed :page_with_curl:

* **0. Lookup**
  * [0-lookup.py](./0-lookup.py)Involves using the prototype function `def lookup(obj):` to return a list of available attributes and method of an object.
  * It also returns the result in a list.

* **1. My list**
  * [1-my_list.py](./1-my_list.py) contains a class `MyList` that inherits from list:
  	* Public instance method: `def print_sorted(self):`: prints the list and sorts it in ascending order.
