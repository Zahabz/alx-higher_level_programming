* What is an object and an instance
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is an attribute
* What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes

* How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
* How to bind attributes to object and classes
* What is the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain
* How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
* How to use the `getattr` function


## Tasks to be completed :page_with_curl:

* **0. My first square**
  * [0-square.py](0-square.py): Defines an empty class `Square`

* **1. Square with size**
  * [1-square.py](1-square.py): Involves creating a class `Square` that defines a square (based on [0-square.py](0-square.py)) with a private instance attribute
`size`

* **2. Size validation**
  * [2-square.py](2-square.py): Defines a square by private instance attribute,
instantiation with optional `size`: `def __init__(self, size=0):`.
